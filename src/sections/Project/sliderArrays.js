      "Chiagozie was a crucial addition to our team, joining just before the launch of our Chrome extension. Despite the lack of a formal onboarding process and the need for a high level of independence in our small team, he seamlessly settled in within a week or less. It's noteworthy that many of the technologies we used were new to him, yet he efficiently completed tasks at a level of proficiency one would expect from someone well-versed in our tech stack. We Collaborated on features, have personally reviewed his code, and can confidently vouch for his exceptional skills as a developer in both writing quality code and problem-solving. In essence, Chiagozie played a pivotal role in the launch of our product, and I'm certain he would bring the same value to any team",

      "I worked with Chiagozie on developing TagU Async. Since we got in touch, I realized he is a very nice person. It is very easy to work with him; he is a fast learner and is not afraid to take on new challenges. He quickly learned some of the libraries and technologies I asked him to work with. He is very committed; his quality of code is excellent, not just focusing on finishing the feature but also making sure to produce clean and scalable code. It has been a pleasure to work with Chiagozie; he has great technical and problem-solving skills. He has shown expertise in Javascript, Typescript, React, and NextJS, working with fetching data from RESTful APIs and also integrating 3rd party services like Notion and Stripe.",
